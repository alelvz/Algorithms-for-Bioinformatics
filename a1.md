# CS249 Assignment 2 Report

## Task 1: Basic genome assembly algorithms

This repository contains implementations and evaluations of two core genome assembly algorithms:

- **De Bruijn Graph (DBG)** assembler
- **Overlap-Layout-Consensus (OLC)** assembler

The algorithms are implemented in the codes dbg.py ( De Bruijn Graph assembler), olc.py (OLC assembler for short reads), and olc_long.py (OLC assembler for long reads)

Usage:

### üöÄ Usage

Below are instructions to run each assembler manually, as well as how to use the provided SLURM scripts for batch processing.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ `dbg.py` ‚Äì De Bruijn Graph Assembler

**Description**: Constructs a de Bruijn graph using k-mers and traverses Eulerian paths to generate contigs.

**Usage**:
```bash
python dbg.py -i <input.fastq> -k <kmer_size> -o <output.fasta> [-c <min_coverage>]
```

Arguments:
-i: Input FASTQ file
-k: K-mer size (e.g., 40)
-o: Output FASTA file
-c: (Optional) Minimum k-mer coverage to keep a node (default: 1)

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ `olc.py` ‚Äì OLC Assembler for Short Reads

**Description**: Computes overlaps between reads using Hamming distance and builds an overlap graph to derive contigs.

**Usage**:
```bash
python olc.py -i <input.fastq> -o <output.fasta> -m <min_overlap> -M <max_mismatches> -c <min_contig_len>
```

Arguments:
-i : Input FASTQ file
-o : Output FASTA file
-m : Minimum required overlap length
-M : Maximum number of mismatches allowed in overlap
-c : Minimum contig length to report

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ `olc_long.py` ‚Äì  OLC Assembler for Long Reads (ONT)

**Description**: Optimized for long, noisy reads from ONT; uses identity threshold instead of mismatch count.

**Usage**:
```bash
python olc_long.py <input.fastq> <output.fasta> -m <min_overlap> -i <min_identity>
```

Arguments:
<input.fastq> : Input FASTQ file (positional)
<output.fasta> : Output FASTA file (positional)
-m : Minimum overlap length
-i : Minimum identity (e.g., 0.80 = 80%)


### üöÄ Run and evaluate
All assemblies were executed using the provided SLURM scripts: `run_dbg.sh` for the De Bruijn Graph assembler and `run_olc.sh` for both short-read and long-read OLC assemblies. Evaluation of the resulting assemblies was performed using QUAST through the `quast.sh` script. The full set of QUAST output reports is stored in the `quast/quast_results/` directory, while a summary of key evaluation metrics across all assemblies is consolidated in `quast/quast_summary.tsv`.

## Task 1.3: Applications of assembly algorithms

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Assembly graph exploration of Toy Reads
