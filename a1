Task 1: Metagenome Classification by String Matching

In this task, reference genomes act as the text and sequencing reads are the patterns being searched for. Using string matching, we classify reads by comparing them against the known reference sequences.
Reference and Read Sizes
Species	Genome Size (bp)
E. coli K-12 MG1655	4,641,652
B. subtilis 168	4,215,606
P. aeruginosa PAO1	6,264,404
S. aureus NCTC 8325	2,821,361
M. tuberculosis H37Rv	4,411,532
Read File	Total bp
